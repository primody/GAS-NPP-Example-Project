# GAS-NPP-5.7.1-Example-Project

This repo is a 5.7.1 version of [GAS-NPP-Simulation](https://github.com/Sabri-Kai/GAS-NPP-Simulation) made by [Sabri-Kai](https://github.com/Sabri-Kai).

I take no credit for any of this. All I did was create a script to automatically download the required plugins for this example project to run on UE 5.7.1.

## Setup

Assuming you have Git, clone the repo and run the Powershell script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/primody/GAS-NPP-5.7.1-Example-Project.git
cd GAS-NPP-5.7.1-Example-Project
powershell Scripts/plugin-setup.ps1
```

If you do not have Git, you can download the zip, extract it, and then run the 3rd command using Powershell.
